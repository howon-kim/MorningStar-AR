You can use methods from /FXVShieldEffect/Scripts/FXVShield.cs to control effects:

    public bool GetIsShieldActive()
    public void SetShieldActive(bool active, bool animated = true)
	
 - to control shield effect direction:
	public void SetShieldEffectDirection(Vector3 dir)

	public void OnHit(Vector3 hitPos, float hitScale)
	
	
You can change look of the effect by assigning different materials to the FXVShield.cs script in gameObject:
- renderer material is the main effect material
- hitMaterial is material used for hit effects, it should use FXVShieldHit.shader
- activationMaterial is material used when activation/deactivation effect is enabled it should use FXVShieldEffect.shader with "Activation Effect Enabled" checkbox on

You can find sample material that You can play with in /FXVShieldEffect/Materials/
